## Convolution Neural Networks
> 1. Conquering MNIST Fashion Dataset using regularization in CNN
It is a dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.

0: T-shirt/top

1: Trouser

2: Pullover

3: Dress

4: Coat

5: Sandal

6: Shirt

7: Sneaker

8: Bag

9: Ankle boot

It is a more challenging classification problem than MNIST and top results are achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks with a classification accuracy of about 90% to 95% on the hold out test dataset.
